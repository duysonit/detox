    Members can be created via the add member form

    Background: I navigate to the Add Member form
        Given I tap on the 'Members' navigation tab section
        And I tap the Add Member icon

    @members @addmembers
    Scenario Outline: I verify that members can be added through the add member form
        When I fill in the form with:
            | name   | surname | b_day   | b_month   | b_year   | address_one    | address_two    | city      | postcode | country   | start_hour   | start_minute   | member        |

        And the Member List page is correctly displayed for <memberCount> members
        When I tap on the Member number <memberCount>
        Then The Show Member page is correctly displayed with:
            | name   | surname | b_day   | b_month   | b_year   | address_one    | address_two    | city      | postcode | country   | start_hour   | start_minute   | member        |
